<p> What did I learn about how I learn?</p>
<br>
<nav class="navigation">
    <ul>
      <li class="sub">The best environment for me to learn new things is the classroom because being around other people who are also working helps me work.</li>
      <li class="sub">The sources of information that helped me the most were examples of other codes that people have made because it helped me understand how certain lines of code can be applied to bigger projects.</li>
      <li class="sub">The projects that were the most successful for me in my opinion were my three.js library projects. I liked these projects the most because I learned every day new exciting coding strategies for the three.js library which is my favorite library and language. Consequently, I applied those skills to my projects making them highly advanced. Moreover, I greatly enjoy HTML and CSS because I think I accomplished great projects using those two languages and I'm excieted to continue using them in the future.</li>
      <li class="sub">When starting computer science I expected to face a lot more obstacles. However, I realized that computer science is simply another language that requires patience and practice to master. Overall, I am satisfied with my improvements throughout this year in computer science and I look forward to continue coding during my spare time.</li>
