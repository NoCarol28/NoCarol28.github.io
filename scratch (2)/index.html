<br><br>

<p> <br> For this scratch project I tried to create a fun and interactive game that was also visually appealing. I enjoyed using the scratch abilities to format for loops, timed functions, and more. This was one of my first projects in computer science and I find it interesting to see how I have improved and the abilities that coding provides me.</p>

<p> <br> For this scratch project I tried to create a fun and interactive game that was also visually appealing. I enjoyed using the scratch abilities to format for loops, timed functions, and more. I used my creativity to create an intersting game that was also fun to play and funny as well as visually appealing. </p>

<p><br> I have learned in the beginning of this year how the logic of coding worked and I believe that scratch showed me the way coding should be used. It was a good application to start the year with. In this project I tried to recreate the famous cartoon show Tom and Jerry. I believe this is an interesting project and extremely fun as well as silly. This project also showed my ability to create for loops, functions, and more on scratch.</p>

<p> <br> I have learned this year that scratch can produce multiple different stamps on a page. For this project I created a for loop and produced an interesting project that was different and showed my ability to produce loops. </p>

<p> <br> For this project I tried to produce a fashion show; however, I wasn't as successful as in my other projects but I learned how to improve my skills. This was the last scratch project I made before I moved onto codepen and codeacademy; therefore, I did not have as much time to work on this project.
